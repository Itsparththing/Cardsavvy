# Cardsavvy: Protecting your COnfidentiality

Protecting contactless cards, also known as RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) cards, is important to prevent unauthorized access to your card's information and protect your financial security. Protecting contactless cards is crucial because these cards are susceptible to various security risks due to their radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology. Without proper protection, contactless cards can be skimmed or scanned by malicious individuals, allowing them to make unauthorized transactions using your card information.
